        Hi, I'm Sakin currently learning web development. Till now I have
        learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Firebase also created various
        front-end application using those tools. So far the learning process has
        been quite fascinating. I want to continue this journey and hope to
        become a full-stack web developer within next 1 year.
